        <p>
          We are fighting to win a world organized and governed by and for the
          vast majority, the working class. We are socialist because we share a
          vision of a humane social order based on popular control of resources
          and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, feminism,
          racial equality and non-oppressive relationships. We are democratic
          because we know that this transformation can only come when millions
          of working-class people stand together. DSA organizes to realize our
          working-class collective power. Socialism is the complete realization
          of democracy.

        <div class="medium bold">What does NIDSA do?</div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Organize! It may sound repetitive, but voicing our demands is the
            first step towards change and nothing gets done locally without some
            organization. We join together with individuals and organizations to
            build protests, elect officials, advocate for legislation, and get
            community care to those who need it. Standing together in numbers
            gets more done and protects all of our rights.
          </li>
          <li>
            Educate. We recognize that the imperialist government has neglected
            public education and used it as a tool of propaganda on all of us.
            Collective and passed-down knowledge is an invaluable tool that we
            want to do our part to provide. To this end, we include frequent
            opportunities to more accurately learn socialist history and theory,
            which obviously includes banned book clubs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Socialize. Political causes are important, but they do not build
            community. We schedule regular social events and coordinate with
            other local organizations to help our local community thrive and get
            to know each other.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="medium bold">What stances do we take?</div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The end of the carceral state and the implementation of sanctuary
            jurisdictions while it persists. Incarceration, detention, and
            policing are active instruments of class war which guarantee the
            domination of the working class and reproduce racial inequalities.
            The origins of policing and prisons and their present-day effects
            demonstrate that they are white supremacist institutions meant to
            replace slavery. This has only gotten worse with the emboldening of
            ICE and the disregard for due process. It is imperative that we band
            together to protect our marginalized communities because not one of
            us is free until all of us are free from this daily threat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Economic justice. We fight for the rights of the working class and
            ever increasing their control over the means of production. We stand
            with labor unions as they are the backbone of the struggle for
            working class rights. We believe in dismantling capitalism and
            redistributing the wealth hoarded by the oligarchy back to the
            masses in the form of human rights guaranteed to everyone (housing,
            medicine, education, food, and water), reinvestment into public
            infrastructure, expanding and ensuring public service and insurance
            availability, public control over communication technology and
            infrastructure, and reregulation of the financial industry.
          </li>
          <li>
            International Solidarity, Anti-Imperialism, and
            Anti-Militarism.Solidarity with comrades around the globe is
            essential to begin undoing the bloody effects of endless wars,
            austerity, colonial exploitation, environmental destruction, stolen
            land, and other atrocities that make up the legacy of US actions in
            service of capital.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gender and Sexuality Justice. We seek nothing less than free and
            self-determined reproductive care, an end to discrimination and
            violence against anyone based on sexual orientation and gender
            identity and expression, dignity for domestic and care workers, and
            to end the state recognition of the gender binary and enforcement of
            heteronormativity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Green New Deal. Capitalism has created an existential crisis for
            humanity through endless extraction, exploitation, and destruction
            of our planet. DSA is fighting for a social order that works for
            people and our planet, not profit. We're fighting for a Green New
            Deal that shifts power to the working class, ends the domination of
            massive corporations over our lives, repairs our infrastructure, and
            regenerates living systems.
